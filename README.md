LLM finetuning, dataset


Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) involves adapting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks by retraining it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process enhances the model's performance in particular domains while retaining its general language understanding capabilities, making it a cost-effective alternative to training a model from scratch.
